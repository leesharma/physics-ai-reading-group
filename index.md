## About

We are a reading group focusing on the intersection of machine learning and computational science and engineering. Topics include, but are not limited to, machine learning methods that embed physical priors, applications of machine learning algorithms to computational science and engineering, uncertainty quantification and trust, integration of numerical and data-driven techniques, and high-performance scientific computing with machine learning.

This group is oriented towards researchers in scientific machine learning and adjacent disciplines as well as anyone else with an academic interest in the area. We'd love to meet you!

To ensure high-quality discussion, please try to read the paper before attending the meeting.

## Meeting Details

This summer, we're (tentatively) meeting alternating Wednesdays, 3:15-4:15pm in IRB 4237.
You can subscribe to our schedule at [talks.cs.umd.edu](https://talks.cs.umd.edu/lists/33).
